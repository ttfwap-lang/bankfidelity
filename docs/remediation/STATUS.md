# Remediation Program Status

**Repository head audited:** `c354094b83e31ca7e026e7749c567931a97a43f4`
**Working branch:** public `master` authorized by the repository owner
**Current phase:** Phase 09 / coherent GUI, batch, recovery, audit UX, and accessibility
**Current gate:** Gate 08 — `NO-GO` for a bundled local LLM; deterministic core retained
**Release publication:** Frozen

## Accepted owner decisions

| Decision | Status | Record |
|---|---|---|
| Python and PyMuPDF remain permanent first-class production components and must be fortified. | Accepted | `adr/ADR-0001-python-first-production-pipeline.md` |
| Windows x64 and macOS Apple Silicon are mandatory customer platforms. | Accepted | `adr/ADR-0002-windows-macos-production-support.md` |
| A local LLM may be added only after benchmark, resource, schema, packaging, and deterministic-safety gates pass. | Gate evaluated; **NO-GO for v1** | `adr/ADR-0003-conditional-local-llm.md` and Gate 08 manifest |
| Functional work precedes non-blocking privacy hardening, but critical data-integrity and active secret/data-exposure defects remain immediate blockers. | Accepted with release safeguards | `adr/ADR-0004-functional-first-privacy-final.md` |
| Repository access uses the owner-authorized public repository. | Verified | `https://github.com/flak3dd/bank-statement-fidelity-editor-remediated` |
| Public `master` publication was explicitly authorized for the remediated source and CI workflow. | Active for this repository | Owner confirmation in task record. |

## Completed checkpoint

Gate 00 established governance and the release freeze at `5c3678c`; Gate 01 established the executable cross-platform base state; Gate 02 closed the critical integrity failure classes at candidate `500167b`; Gate 03 closed the unified runtime at candidate `c84c631`; Gate 04 closed the permanent supervised Python/PyMuPDF production pipeline at candidate `85e15fc`; Gate 05 closed extraction completeness and financial correctness at candidate `9e5e8a1`; Gate 06 closed exact PDF mutation and atomic publication at candidate `9136721`; Gate 07 closed independent fail-closed verification at candidate `c354094` in CI run `30730576656`; and Gate 08 closed with an explicit no-local-LLM v1 decision.

## Open decisions with later blocking phases

| Decision | Default until owner responds | Blocks |
|---|---|---|
| macOS Intel/universal support | Apple Silicon only | Phase 10 packaging |
| PyMuPDF Pro redistribution/license model | User-provided key; core capability must be truthful without it | Phase 10 packaging |
| Required cloud providers for v1 | Optional providers remain quarantined until contract-qualified | Phase 05/11 |
| Local OCR distribution | Optional component with explicit model capability | Phase 05/10 |
| Signing identities/certificates | Build unsigned internal candidates only; no GA | Phase 10/13 |
| Remote processing service | Excluded from v1 unless separately approved and designed | Phase 09/10 |
| Typst reconstruction | Removed from fidelity finalization; legacy operation is disabled and non-mutating | Closed in Phase 06 |

## Next executable work

1. Commit and push the evidence-only Gate 06 closure without modifying the default branch.
2. Start Phase 07 from verified candidate `9136721` while retaining every prior gate.
3. Rebuild the independent structural, pixel, geometry, content, editability, and financial verifier gates.
4. Calibrate thresholds on authorized unchanged, positive, negative, drift, font, geometry, and partial-application fixtures; fail closed on missing evidence.
